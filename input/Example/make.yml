      title: "Example SBOM"
      description: >-
        A software bill of materials(SBOM) is a list of components in a piece of software. Software vendors often create products by assembling open source and commercial software components. The SBOM describes the components in a product. It is analogous to a list of ingredients on food packaging: where you might consult a label to avoid foods that may cause an allergies, SBOMs can help organizations or persons avoid consumption of software that could harm them.
